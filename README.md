# Mini Pinterest

Simple pinterest iOS app using the Pinterest iOS SDK. This was based on a code challenge.

## Features
* Written in Swift 3 using a Bridging Header file to use PinterestSDK
* Authenticates users with Pinterest
* Supports a view of the user's boards
* Selecting a board opens a view containing a feed of pins

## Looking forward
Future versions of this app might include a detail view for each pin, pin image sizes uniformly lined in Pins view, ability to add pins to a user's board, image caching, integrations with other APIs, navigation, more.
